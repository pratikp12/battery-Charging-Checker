## Description
One day I was working on my Laptop and suddenly I saw laptop charging is indicating 20%. That day I thought what if I write a script that works in the background and inform the user when the battery reaches 40%. Sometime during working Hours we forget to check battery of laptop.
So i write python script that check laptop battery every 15 minutes. If battery is less than 40% it will send mail to user.
Mail content current battery status and greetings like good morning or good afternoon. While charging is on It will not send any mail.
I implement code that will mail user if battery reaches to 100% and user is still charging laptop.
